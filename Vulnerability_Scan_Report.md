# Vulnerability Scan Report

## 1. Introduction  
This report presents the results of a vulnerability scan conducted on the target system to identify open ports and running services. The scan was performed using **Nmap**, a network scanning tool. The target system scanned was **local machine (127.0.0.1)**.

## 2. Methodology  
The scan was conducted using the following Nmap command:

## 4. Analysis  
- **Port 135 (msrpc):** This port is used for Remote Procedure Call in Windows. It is commonly open and required for many Windows services.  
- **Port 445 (microsoft-ds):** This port supports SMB file sharing. It can be a security risk if exposed to untrusted networks due to vulnerabilities like EternalBlue.  
- **Port 5357 (http):** This port is used by the Microsoft HTTPAPI service (often for UPnP). It can be exploited if left unsecured.

## 5. Recommendations  
- Close any ports not required for daily operation to reduce the attack surface.  
- Ensure all software related to open ports is up to date with the latest security patches.  
- Use a firewall to restrict access to critical ports, especially when connected to public networks.  
- Regularly conduct vulnerability scans to detect any changes or new risks.

## 6. Conclusion  
The vulnerability scan identified several open ports on the target system. While some ports are necessary for normal operation, others may pose potential security risks if not properly managed. Regular scanning and applying security best practices help maintain system security.
